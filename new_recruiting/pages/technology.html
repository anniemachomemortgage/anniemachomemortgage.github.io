			<h3>Funnel IQ System, Your Automated Multichannel Follow-Up System:</h3>
			<p>Spend more time prospecting and less time following up. Enter a new lead into your database and automatically trigger a comprehensive follow-up campaign which includes text, ring-less voicemails (via SlyBroadcast) and emails (via Virtual Assistant), all addressed from and branded as you. Once the new lead responds, the campaign automatically halts and you take control of the conversation. With Funnel IQ you can automate sales force tasks in your own voice while reaching contacts in whatever medium they prefer.</p>
