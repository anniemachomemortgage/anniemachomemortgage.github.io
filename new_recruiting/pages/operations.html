Do not just build a career, build a life you are proud of. 
 
At AnnieMac, we treat every step of the loan process with the utmost care, as each one is ultimately a building block towards our borrower’s satisfaction. Our qualified Operations Compliance Review team ensures that each loan is getting the proper attention it deserves by going through the following steps:
 
Initial Disclosures
Opening
Re-disclosures 
Initial CD's
Compliance Review Prior to Closing
Our Operations Compliance Review Department will:
 
Monitor all fee variances and rate locks for the whole company.
Handle re-disclosures for any branches that request us to do so.
Manage requests (received in the loan itself or via email) for revised LE’s, Initial CD’s and revised CD’s through a dedicated queue. 
 
Additionally, RESPA review handles TRID timing and disclosure requirements and provides feedback.
