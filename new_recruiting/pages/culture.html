			“Culture matters in this business and ours is hands down the best of any company I know of. It makes a true difference when the leaders are engaged in ensuring we take care of the customer and provide the best service and experience possible. Our entire philosophy of providing more comes from the top down and embodies everything we do every day…that’s pretty special.”

			AnnieMac Home Mortgage values work, but also values culture and the personal life of every employee. We understand the importance of giving back to the community and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. We care about all aspects of our employees and our leaders continue to promote a culture of contagious positivity.

			"The big difference with Annie Mac for me is- not only do I look forward to working with these people every day, but I get just as excited to see those same people outside of work. I have made lifelong friendships at Annie Mac that extend well beyond work hours. I have seen this company grow a lot over the last 8 years or so and we have always kept true to the family environment our leaders here have created. I truly feel that because of my time at Annie Mac I’ll always have people that I can lean on both professionally and personally whenever I need it."
			-Nick Cuticcia, Branch Support Manager

			When a company works together, success happens in both the professional and personal life of employees. The AnnieMac culture is intoxicating, captivating, and full of heart. We do not just say we care; we prove that we care in more ways than one.

			"When a company says you are all family, AnnieMac truly means it. The hardworking yet fun-loving culture is something I have never experienced in my prior professional career. Especially in a remote working atmosphere, management understands the difficulty of being home with children and is always willing to accommodate flexibility in your schedule to ensure you succeed in your career while maintaining a work-life balance."
			-Kelsey Graeger, Appraisal Coordination Team Lead

			Community Relations and Charity

			Everything we do at AnnieMac has one thing in common: HEART

			From our commitment to customer service to our employee-friendly culture, our consistent goal is to put people first, and we firmly believe that all of our success can be traced back to that mindset. Sure, we want to help people realize their dreams and build happier homes, but we are equally interested in helping the community at large, including our own AnnieMac family.

			Here are a few of our programs designed to give back to those around us:

			AnnieMac Healing Heroes, in support of Freedom Service Dogs of America - Freedom Service Dogs of America takes in rescue dogs, trains them to be service dogs, and provides them free-of-charge to people facing physical, mental or psychological challenges who would benefit from an animal to assist them. In doing so, they help both people and animals through a variety of programs.

			In addition to year-round fundraising efforts for this cause. Healing Heroes holds an annual “Fetch the Ball” Golf Tournament each year. This daylong event includes a full day of golfing, a sit-down dinner and plenty of opportunity for sponsorship, networking and fun, all while raising money to train and provide service dogs to those who need it most.

			Beyond our signature philanthropies, AnnieMac happily supports a wide variety of other local and national charities throughout the year. Some of the groups and events we have worked with include:

			NJ's Cathedral Kitchen - the largest emergency food provider in Camden, NJ, serving more than 100,000 meals a year.

			Toys for Tots - a program run by the United States Marine Corps Reserve which distributes toys to children whose parents cannot afford to buy them gifts for Christmas.

			Habitat for Humanity - helps people in your community and around the world build or improve a place they can call home.

			The AnnieMac Family Culture

			Not only does AnnieMac care for our local communities, but our leaders have implemented programs to enhance our work community.

			AnnieMac Culture Committee - AnnieMac’s Culture Committee, made up entirely of volunteers from within the AnnieMac family, aims to foster a caring and comfortable atmosphere in the workplace and beyond. The team works tirelessly to create fun employee events and activities that help bring AnnieMac employees together as a community. In addition to team building, the Culture Committee’s consistent focus is to raise money for one of AnnieMac’s most important endeavors, the Sunshine Fund.

			Sunshine Fund - Established in 2017, this program is our companies’ way to help fellow AnnieMac members in need. Through this fund, the Culture Committee raises the financial resources to provide that support whenever the need arises.

			Whether we are raising money for local organizations, planning a seminar on healthy eating habits, or organizing a team trip to Top Golf, AnnieMac's cultural goal stays the same: Provide a positive workplace, encourage the goals of our individual employees, come together as a team to support our community, and recognize the importance of life outside of work.
