					I can’t say enough good things about the level of support and attention to detail that AnnieMac’s Transition Team provided while we on-boarded... it was truly amazing. We transitioned 26 employees over 3 locations and it was completely seamless. Their support allowed us to open at full speed with almost zero downtime, so we didn’t miss a beat in production. Our first closing was 14 days after start... not business days, 14 days total! The team’s support while onboarding coupled with the tools, products, and brand of AnnieMac Home Mortgage make this the shop to be at, without question.

				<blockquote class="long-quote">
					Here at AnnieMac, we put a great amount of thought and effort into our training program. Envision the process of recruiting, onboarding, and training a new hire as that of inflating a balloon. From the moment we introduce ourselves to a potential new hire, we are filling it with all sorts of information, energy, and hope about raising one’s career to new heights. Every conversation, every interaction helps fill that balloon. After all, those hopes and dreams, goals, and horizons are part of the success we all want to be part of here at AnnieMac.
