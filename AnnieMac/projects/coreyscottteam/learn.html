				<h3>Our Loans</h3>
				<p>You have many options for types of loan, including loan options for veterans, people looking for homes in rural areas, borrowers who have experienced credit problems in the past, homes in more expensive areas, and homeowners looking to renovate or even build a property. We recommend you look at some of the options, as it may have an impact on what type of home you consider buying.</p>

					<h4>Conventional Loans</h4>
					<p>A conventional home loan is a mortgage that is not insured by the federal government, so their terms are more flexible than USDA, FHA or VA loans. Offering low interest rates, they are a great fit for customers with good credit and financial stability who can afford a down payment.</p>

					<h4>VA Loans</h4>
					<p>The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs coordinates a loan program for current and former members of the U.S. armed forces (and some surviving spouses). These loans offer many advantages, including no down payment, no private mortgage insurance, low rates, and flexible underwriting guidelines.</p>

							<p>A conventional home loan is a mortgage that is not insured by the federal government, so their terms are more flexible than USDA, FHA or VA loans. Offering low interest rates, they are a great fit for customers with good credit and financial stability who can afford a down payment.</p>
							<h4>Why would a Conventional Loan be the best choice for you?</h4>
							<p><strong>Simplicity</strong> – Without Federal Government-mandated procedures to deal with, Conventional loans are simple to apply and qualify for.</p>
							<p><strong>Flexibility</strong> – With tons of options and customizable terms available, we can craft a conventional loan that perfectly aligns with your financial status and long-term goals.</p>
							<p><strong>Affordable Down Payments</strong> – Required down-payments can be set as low as 3% of the home cost, making Conventional Loans more attainable than ever.</p>
							<p><strong>Loan Interest Rates</strong> – By confirming our customers’ financial stability and credit score, we can offer amazingly low interest rates.</p>
							<h4>What are the qualifications for a Conventional Loan?</h4>
							<p>For starters, you’ll need proof of income, two years of documented tax returns, and cash reserves to cover closing and additional costs.</p>
							<h4>Credit Criteria</h4>
							<p>You should also carry good credit (typically a FICO score of 620 or greater), and total debt that does not exceed 45% of your income.</p>
							<h4>Down Payment</h4>
							<p>You will also likely need to provide a down payment on the home (as low as 3%, but ideally 20% or more in order to remove the possibility of paying a monthly Mortgage Insurance tax.)</p>
							<h4>Mortgage Insurance</h4>
							<p>Mortgage insurance is an insurance policy that protects a mortgage lender or titleholder if the borrower defaults on payments, dies or is unable to meet the contractual obligations of the mortgage. One commonly-required insurance type is Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).</p>
							<h4>Loan Limitations</h4>
							<p>As of 2019, that limit for most of the country is $484,350. That limit can go higher in counties where the housing costs tend to exceed the national average – up to $726,525 in some cases.</p>

							<p>Created by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt as part of the original Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, VA loans help create homeownership for service members who have sacrificed so much for their country, yet do not have a fair chance to establish a credit rating because of their service</p>
							<p>Insured through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VA loans do not require the borrower to make any down payment or to get private mortgage insurance, amounting to substantial savings. Rates are also lower, and the underwriting standards are far more lenient.</p>
							<p>Simply put — if you are a current or former member of the U.S. armed forces, you are unlikely to get a better deal with any other kind of loan.</p>
							<p>We have licensed mortgage originators who specialize in VA loans and who are dedicated to getting you the best program for your individual needs. They will not just sell you a home loan, but help review your current financial situation and long-term goals. Our loan officers will then determine which loan will best suit your individual needs</p>
							<h4>Why would a VA Loan be the best choice for you?</h4>
							<p>VA loans offer many advantages for current or former service members. Whether you are looking to buy a home or refinance, you can do so without many of the expenses or restrictions that apply to people seeking conventional loans. This program is in place specifically for your benefit, so why not take advantage of it?</p>
							<p><strong>Flexible Underwriting Guidelines</strong> – VA-backed loans are far less stringent than conventional loans when it comes to evaluating your qualifications as a borrower, such as debt-to-income ratio and credit. That even applies to past events such as bankruptcies and foreclosures.</p>
							<p><strong>No Down Payment Required</strong> – The VA recognizes that members of the military can have difficulty establishing good credit. For that reason, borrowers using a VA loan can finance 100 percent of the home’s value with no money down, often saving tens of thousands of dollars in the process.</p>
							<p><strong>No Pre-Payment Penalty</strong> – Many loan types have a penalty for paying off a mortgage before it matures. VA loans have no such penalty, which means you can pay it off early. That gives you more flexibility if you are looking to refinance or pursue other options down the road.</p>
							<p><strong>Low Interest Rates</strong> – VA loans typically have lower interest rates than conventional loans — anywhere from .5 to 1 percent lower. This can amount to tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of savings over the life of the loan.</p>
							<p><strong>No Private Mortgage Insurance</strong> – If borrowers cannot contribute a minimum down-payment of 20 percent, lenders usually require private mortgage insurance. Since VA loans are insured by the Federal Government, borrowers do not need private mortgage insurance. This saves them a significant amount of money and allows them to build more equity in the home.</p>
							<p><strong>Re-usability</strong> – As long as you pay off the loan each time, you can use the benefits of a VA loan over and over. Even if you have had a problem such as a foreclosure or currently have a VA loan, you may be able to get another one. Someone else can even take on the loan if they are deemed eligible by the VA.</p>
							<h4>What are the qualifications for a VA Loan?</h4>
							<p>If you meet the basic service requirements specified by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, you are eligible for a VA loan — whether you are on active duty, a veteran, a National Guard member, or a reservist. You may also be eligible if your spouse is in the military while on active duty or due to a disability connected to his or her service. The VA, which insures the home loans, makes the ultimate decision with regards to eligibility. But even if you are eligible under VA criteria, we still must verify that you meet eligibility requirements such as credit and debt.</p>
							<h4>Certificate of Eligibility</h4>
							<p>A Certificate of Eligibility (provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs) verifies the length and nature of your service. As a VA-approved vendor, we will be able to obtain a COE on your behalf once you provide proof of your military service. If you would prefer to obtain the certificate yourself, you can apply by mail with VA Form 26-1880, or go through the VA’s eBenefits portal.</p>
							<h4>Income Requirements</h4>
							<p>VA loan borrowers are expected to have a reliable and steady income that will cover their monthly mortgage payment and other basic living expenses. The VA also requires a certain amount of “residual income,” or money left over each month to provide for expenses such as food, utilities, transportation, etc. What constitutes “residual income” varies according to geographic region, but your licensed mortgage originator will help you determine that</p>
							<h4>Personal Occupancy</h4>
							<p>Since VA loans were specifically created to give those who have served our country an affordable lifestyle, borrowers are only allowed to use them for homes that they will personally occupy, not rental properties. Many housing options are eligible for VA loans, including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Single-family homes, up to four units</li>
								<li>Existing homes with renovations needed (renovations can be financed under the same loan)</li>
								<li>Newly constructed homes</li>
								<li>Manufactured homes or lots</li>
								<li>Condominiums in a VA-approved project</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>Loan Limitations</h4>
							<p>As of 2019, that limit for most of the country is $484,350. That limit can go higher in counties where the housing costs tend to exceed the national average – up to $726,525 in some cases.</p>
							<h4>What is the application process for VA Loans?</h4>
							<p>Applying for any mortgage loan can seem complicated and intimidating. Our goal at AnnieMac Home Mortgage is to comfortably guide you through the entire process as easily and quickly as possible so that you can begin enjoying your new home. Here is a quick overview of the application process:</p>
							<h4>Apply for a Certificate of Eligibility (COE)</h4>
							<p>You will need this to demonstrate that you qualify for the VA home loan benefit. (See “eligibility” section.)</p>
							<h4>Review Your Current Finances</h4>
							<p>Check your credit, which includes getting your latest credit score. You can get a free copy of your credit report once a year from www.annualcreditreport.com. You will also want to decide how much you are willing to spend on a mortgage – including closing costs – and weigh it against other considerations such as your monthly income and expenses, and long-term savings goals such as a children’s college fund.</p>
							<h4>Decide On A Lender</h4>
							<p>While rates will be a factor, keep in mind that they are not the only consideration, or necessarily the most important one. A good lender will take the time to help you review your finances and your long-term financial goals, and help you select the right mortgage program for your situation.</p>
							<h4>Find A Real Estate Agent</h4>
							<p>We have an extensive list of referral partners and would be happy to recommend an agent if you need one. A good agent will not only help you find a home, but also make sure that you understand all the charges, fees and commissions associated with a sale.</p>
							<h4>Find The Right Home</h4>
							<p>Now comes the process of shopping for the right home. You will want to consider whether a home is in your price range, but also consider factors such as the condition of the local school district, the neighborhood, and the location of amenities such as grocery stores and parks.</p>
							<h4>With Your Agent, Craft And Sign A Purchase Agreement</h4>
							<p>The contract should include a “VA Escape Clause,” giving you the option of voiding it if the property does not appraise for the contract price.</p>
							<h4>Get An Appraisal And Inspection For The House.</h4>
							<p>The program requires that any property financed with a VA loan must get appraised by a VA-approved appraiser, who will make sure that it meets some basic requirements for safety and livability. Keep in mind that an appraisal is different from an inspection. While it is not mandatory, an inspection is still especially important for the buying process.</p>
							<h4>Go Over The Pre-Closing Paperwork And Give Your Lender Any Other Needed Information.</h4>
							<p>At least three business days before closing, your lender will provide you with a Closing Disclosure which will include particulars of the loan. Read it carefully and be prepared to provide more information if requested.</p>
							<h4>Go To The Closing.</h4>
							<p>This may take place at an escrow office, attorney’s office, or title company. Be prepared to sign a lot of paperwork.</p>

							<p>An FHA loan is a mortgage designed for low-to-moderate-income borrowers. Insured by the Federal Housing Administration, FHA loans require a lower minimum down payment and credit scores than many conventional loans.</p>
							<p>As a fully licensed FHA Direct Endorsement Lender, we offer a wide variety of FHA loan products to meet your specific needs. AnnieMac Home Mortgage has helped thousands of families in need of affordable financing alternatives, and we would love to do the same for you.</p>
							<h4>Why would an FHA Loan Be the best choice for you?</h4>
							<p><strong>Lower Credit Requirements</strong> – Unlike other loan types, property buyers with credit scores as low as 500 can qualify for an FHA loan.</p>
							<p><strong>Lower Mortgage Insurance Premiums</strong> – Same money with each payment, year after year.</p>
							<p><strong>Affordable Down Payments</strong> – Mandatory down-payments can be set as low as 3.5% of the home’s cost, minimizing the need for available cash up-front.</p>
							<p><strong>More Opportunities For Assistance</strong> – In addition to lower down-payments and interest rates, FHA borrowers can take advantage of unique benefits like Down Payment Assistance programs, Down Payment Gifts, and Up to 6% Seller Assist.</p>
							<h4>What are the qualifications for an FHA Loan?</h4>
							<p>For starters, you will need proof of income and employment, along with the pre-established means to cover a down payment and closing costs.</p>
							<h4>Debt-to-Income Ratio</h4>
							<p>Your debt-to-income ratio (FHA loans require less than 43%) is all your monthly debt payments divided by your gross monthly income. Lenders use this number to predict your ability to manage monthly mortgage payments.</p>
							<h4>Down Payment</h4>
							<p>You will also need to provide a down payment on the home. FHA loans allow for down payments as low as 3.5% of the cost of the property.</p>
							<h4>Mortgage Insurance</h4>
							<p>Mortgage insurance is an insurance policy that protects a mortgage lender or titleholder if the borrower defaults on payments, dies, or is unable to meet the contractual obligations of the mortgage. FHA borrowers may receive lower mortgage insurance rates than they would with other loan types.</p>
							<h4>Loan Limitations</h4>
							<p>As of 2022, the FHA loan limits for most of the country are $420,680. That limit can go higher in counties where the housing costs tend to exceed the national average – up to $809,150 in some cases.</p>

							<p>The United States Department of Agriculture developed this mortgage option to improve the economy and quality of life in rural America by encouraging the purchasing of rural land. USDA loans are issued through the USDA Rural Development Guaranteed Housing Loan Program, and you might be surprised how feasible it is to qualify for one beyond what most would consider “farmland”.</p>
							<h4>Why would a USDA Loan be the best choice for you?</h4>
							<p><strong>Availability</strong> – Contrary to their name, USDA Rural Development home loans are not exclusively for agricultural areas, or even for places far out in the country.</p>
							<p><strong>No Down Payments</strong> – A USDA loan is one of the only loan programs offered to the general public that allows you to finance 100% of your home’s value. That means no down payment of any kind!</p>
							<p><strong>Rolled-in Closing Costs</strong> – A USDA loan is the only loan type on the market that allows you to finance your closing costs up to the appraised value.</p>
							<p><strong>Long-Term Stability</strong> – For income-qualified borrowers, USDA’s provide competitive Fixed Interest Rates at Affordable 30-Year Terms.</p>
							<h4>What are the qualifications for an USDA Loan?</h4>
							<p>For starters, you will need proof of US citizenship or permanent residency. Your intended property purchase must serve as a primary residence within a qualified rural area.</p>
							<h4>Credit Criteria</h4>
							<p>You should carry good credit (typically a score of 640 or greater) to be eligible for the USDA’s automated underwriting system. It is still possible to qualify for manual underwriting with a lower credit score, although you may be held to more stringent guidelines.</p>
							<h4>Income Requirements</h4>
							<p>Your adjusted household income is equal to or less than 115% of the area median income.</p>
							<h4>Loan Limitations</h4>
							<p>You can apply for a USDA Loan for up to a $453,100 purchase price.</p>
