Looking for a passionate professional that’s delighted to help loan originators find their ideal home? You found her!

Hi, I’m Rachael Tresch and I understand that the road to reaching your destination can be paved with many questions and concerns. That’s actually really common so if that’s you, you’re not alone. That’s why I’m here! I joined AnnieMaC as a Business Development Manger, with an utmost desire to achieve exponential success as an integral member of the team. As someone with a strong work ethic, I constantly demonstrates persistence and resourcefulness in creating innovative solutions and building long-lasting relationships.  

In my prior experience, I worked as an established Voiceover Actor, Vocal Coach, and Performer on a mission to inspire my listeners through the power of storytelling. Over the years, I had the privilege of working on many national projects for Amazon, PetSmart and Scholastic to name a few! I was also the owner and operator at Sing! Voice Studio for 11 years. I mentored and coached young singers and actors to achieve a higher level of success both personally and professionally.  

I also worked with CoreStates Capital Advisors, LLC as a media liaison and coordinator placing advisors on national television and radio programs including CNBC, Bloomberg TV & Radio, The Wall Street Transcript, and USA Today.  

I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Communication Studies from Northeastern University, Boston. When I'm not in the studio, I love spending time with my two crazy kiddos, listening to audio books, playing tennis, serving as a worship leader at my church and singing and playing guitar with my hubby! 

I’m delighted walk you through the process to help make your dream come true! I’m what many could refer to as the business development “fairy godmother” at AnnieMac! There’s that yellow brick road before you but picture AnnieMac as your Emerald City of mortgage companies. I’m there to stand beside you as you journey ahead. 

I fully understand that loan originators have a very stressful job and seem to work around the clock. Therefore, at AnnieMac we have created a structure that allows you to have more time for yourself and provide platforms that you can rely on! To add to that, I have the pleasure of getting to know my clients and love listening to their stories of how they arrived at where they are today. It’s an honor to assist them and figure out what their goals are as well as understand where they want to take their business. 

Remember how the Fairy Godmother delighted in a happy ending? That’s me! It’s my delight to provide you with a place where your goals and dreams come true.... all under one roof! If you’re searching for someone that is knowledgeable and compassionate in this field….you’ve found her! I invite you to reach out and connect with me because I’m enthusiastic to take the next step with you!
