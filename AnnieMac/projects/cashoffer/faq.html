				<details class="">
					<summary> What is an AnnieMac Cash2Keys Cash Offer? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>A Cash2Keys offer is a purchase contract backed by a cash offer. After a short due diligence period where you can have a home inspection and appraisal, the cash offer becomes non-refundable, and the seller knows that it will close. You may choose to have the purchase contract assigned to you so that you close as the buyer or have Cash2Keys close quickly and then sell the property to you for the same price.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Why are Cash Offers better than an offer with mortgage financing? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Sellers love cash offers and prefer them to financed offers. With an AnnieMac Cash2Keys Cash Offer, the seller knows that after the due diligence period the transaction is sure to close based on the terms of the offer and the backing of AnnieMac Private Equity Cash2Key.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>How do I get started on an AnnieMac Cash Offer? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p><a href="" class="faq-link">Apply Here</a> After you complete your application, AnnieMac will be in touch to guide you towards your pre-approval.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What’s the catch? What do I have to pay for the Cash Offer service? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>You pay a 1.5% Cash Offer fee that can be refunded at your closing when you use AnnieMac Home Mortgage and Community Title. If your offer is not accepted, there is no Cash Offer Fee.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Where do you get the cash to purchase the home for me?<i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>We fund off our operating account and warehouse lines established with partners.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Can I use my own agent?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Yes. Buying a home is a truly personal process. Only you can pick the best agent to guide and advocate for you.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Who controls the negotiations?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Just like a typical purchase, you and your agent have control over the negotiations and your due diligence (including inspection).</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Is an appraisal required?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>AnnieMac Home Mortgage requires an appraisal in many transactions. If you choose another lender, they will likely require an appraisal in most transactions.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Who pays for the home inspection and the appraisal?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>As with most home purchases, the buyer will pay for the home inspection and appraisal.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Where are Cash Offers available? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Cash Offers are currently available in Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester Counties in NJ.  As our programs expand to new markets, our website and FAQ’s will be updated to include those areas.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What does the Cash Offer process look like?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>These are the main steps in a Cash Offer transaction:
						Get pre-approved. Work with AnnieMac Home Mortgage to submit your income and asset documentation for a full review. If you are pre-approved, you are assigned a Home Purchase Coordinator that will work with you and your agent.
						
						Cash Offer Agreement. Your Home Purchase Coordinator will discuss the steps and what is required of you upfront. They will give you this information in writing, and there will be an agreement with AnnieMac Cash2Keys to submit a cash offer on your behalf.
						
						Make a cash offer. Find the home you’ll love. Your real estate agent and your Cash2Keys Home Purchase Coordinator will spring into action to draft and submit the cash offer. Based on how quickly you want to close, you will decide whether to have the purchase contract assignable to you or have Cash2Keys do a quick closing and later resell the property to you.
						
						Secure your home. When seller accepts your offer, your agent can arrange for the home to be inspected and the property appraised. You will review your disclosure documents, submit your earnest money deposit (3% of the purchase price on a primary residence), and review your home inspection.
						
						Close on your new home. If you elected to have the purchase contract assignable to you, your mortgage will be processed and you will close on your new home, backed by an AnnieMac Cash Offer.
						
						Buy back your new home. If you elected to enable a Cash2Keys Quick Close to meet a seller’s request for a quick close, you will buy your new home from Cash2Keys as soon as your mortgage is ready. In states that charge a real estate transfer tax, you will be required to pay all the transfer tax for this transaction.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Who is the Home Purchase Coordinator and what do they do?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>The Home Purchase Coordinator works for AnnieMac Cash2Keys and is a specialist in Cash Offer and Buy Now, Sell Later. You are assigned a dedicated Home Purchase Coordinator and may speak with a different Home Purchase Coordinator if your dedicated HPC is unavailable.
						
					The HPC is there to educate you on Cash Offer or Buy Now, Sell Later. They will walk you through the steps of the transaction beforehand so you know what happens at every step of the transaction and what will be required of you. The HPC will also communicate with your agent. 
					
					The HPC does not work with you on your mortgage. You will work with your Loan Officer and Processor for all your mortgage needs.
					</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Can I get an inspection? What happens if the inspection comes back with issues? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Yes, the cash purchase contract executed between AnnieMac Cash2Keys and the seller allows for an inspection. You and your agent have complete control over negotiating any issues uncovered in the inspection that you choose to address with the seller. We will not purchase a home unless you and your agent are satisfied with its condition.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>How do you make money?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>We charge a Cash Offer fee that is typically 1.5% of the purchase price. If you use AnnieMac Home Mortgage and Community Title to purchase your home, the 1.5% Cash Offer fee is refunded in full. Either we make money on the Cash Offer fee, or we refund the Cash Offer fee to you and make money on the mortgage and title.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>When do I pay the Cash Offer Fee?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>You pay an earnest money deposit and incorporated Cash Offer fee within 3 days of getting under contract. If you use AnnieMac Home Mortgage and Community Title to purchase your home, the 1.5% Cash Offer fee is refunded in full.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Are AnnieMac Home Mortgage interest rates higher when used to finance a home using Cash Offer or Buy Now, Sell Later?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Nope! The same low interest rates are used for Cash Offer and Buy Now, Sell Later, with no additional points.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Does AnnieMac Cash2Keys work with buyers looking to buy investment properties?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Not currently. AnnieMac Cash2Keys is dedicated to making homeownership attainable and only works for transactions for a primary residence.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Is AnnieMac Cash2Keys an iBuyer?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>No. AnnieMac Cash2Keys empowers you to make a cash offer on your home.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Do I have to use AnnieMac Home Mortgage when I use Cash Offer or Buy Now, Sell Later?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>You are not obligated to use AnnieMac Home Mortgage, but we’d love to work with you and offer exclusive discounts, unparalleled service and other benefits that you won’t find anywhere else.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>How long does it take to get a Cash Offer Pre-Approval?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>With a full submission of application and credit with income, employment, and asset documentation, underwriting pre-approval times are currently 48-72 hours.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>If I am already pre-approved with a lender, do I need a pre-approval from AnnieMac Home Mortgage?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Yes, the Cash Offer pre-approval is a separate approval.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What happens after I am pre-approved with AnnieMac Cash2Key?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>You will be assigned a Home Purchase Coordinator. The Home Purchase Coordinator will discuss the process with you and provide you with a written Cash Offer agreement that lays out the steps and specific requirements. You will then shop for your new home with your real estate agent.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What if I need to sell my home to buy another?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Buy Now, Sell Later, as the name states, allows you to turn this traditional requirement on its head and buy before you sell. AnnieMac Cash2Keys will make a cash offer on your behalf and allow you to move in and rent immediately upon closing. The rent is accrued but not immediately paid, so you will never have two housing payments. After you have sold your old home, you will buy your new home back from Cash2Keys.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What is the AnnieMac Buy Now, Sell Later program?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Buy Now, Sell Later eliminates the need to sell your home before you buy. Instead of listing your home with nowhere to move, AnnieMac Cash2Keys will make a cash offer on your behalf before you sell. When the offer is accepted and Cash2Keys closes, you move into the property and accrue rent that you pay later, after you have sold your home. Buy and move first, then prep and stage your home to maximize your sale price.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Does AnnieMac Buy Now, Sell Later purchase your current home?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>AnnieMac wants you and your agent to sell your property to the highest offer. For this reason, we allow you to move into your new home and have two weeks of preparation to make it shine for potential borrowers. We only purchase your old home as a last resort. If your home has not sold in 180 days, AnnieMac purchases your home for the established conditional purchase price so you can take title to your new home.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>How much will the rent be on my home until I complete the purchase? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>The rent will be approximately what mortgage, tax, and insurance payments will be on the property. You will accrue rent from the day that AnnieMac Cash2Keys purchases your property but will not pay the rent until you sell your home. The rent will be pro-rated on a daily basis, so you won’t pay a full month’s rent if you rent for less than the full month. The Buy Now, Sell Later agreement that you sign after pre-approval specifies your rental payment.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>How do you determine how much equity I have in my home?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Typically, an interior BPO (broker price opinion) must be conducted on your current home.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Do I need renter’s insurance while I rent and before I buy?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>You should strongly consider renter’s insurance. Our insurance does not cover your personal property.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Are pets allow while you are renting?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Of course! All family members are welcome.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Does my agent still make money off the transaction?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Yes.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>If my state charges a real estate transfer tax, how is this handled across the two transactions?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>If you are participating in Buy Now, Sell Later or choose not to have the purchase contract assignable to you, there will be two transactions. AnnieMac Cash2Keys will pay any buyers share of transfer tax on the first transaction. On the second transaction, you will pay all transfer taxes associated with that transaction.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What does the Buy Now, Sell Later process look like?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>These are the main steps in a Buy Now, Sell Later transaction:
						Get pre-approved. Work with AnnieMac Home Mortgage to submit your income and asset documentation for a full review and have your interior broker price opinion completed on your current home. If you are pre-approved with Buy Now, Sell Later, you are assigned a Home Purchase Coordinator that will work with you and your agent.
						
						Buy Now, Sell Later Agreement. Your Home Purchase Coordinator will discuss the steps and what is required of you upfront. They will give you this information in writing, and there will be a Buy Now, Sell Later agreement with AnnieMac Cash2Keys to submit a cash offer on your behalf. This agreement will also contain a conditional purchase price to buy your current residence in 181 days if it does not sell sooner. Most homes sell sooner.
						
						Make a cash offer. Find the home you’ll love. When you do, your real estate agent and your Cash2Keys Home Purchase Coordinator will spring into action to draft and submit the cash offer.
						
						Secure your home. When the seller accepts your offer, you and your agent can arrange for the home to be inspected and the property appraised. You will review your disclosure documents, submit your earnest money deposit (3% of the purchase price on a primary residence), and review your home inspection.
						
						Cash2Keys close. AnnieMac Cash2Keys will close on your new home. When they do, you take possession and can move in right away! Your rental period begins the day Cash2Keys closes but the rent is not paid until you take title.
						
						List your old home for sale. Maybe your home needed some touch up or staging to maximize your sale price. With two weeks from the Cash2Keys close before you must list your home for sale, you’ll have just enough time to get your home looking great so that buyers bid aggressively.
						
						Close on the sale of your old home and buy back your new one. When your old home sells, you are ready to complete your purchase. In the unlikely event that your home did not sell in 180 days, Cash2Keys will purchase it according to the terms of the conditional purchase price. In states that charge a real estate transfer tax, you will be required to pay all of the transfer tax for this final transaction.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Is AnnieMac Private Equity Cash2Keys a mortgage lender?  <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>No, AnnieMac Cash2Keys is not a financial institution. We are a business entity that purchases homes to secure them for you, our customers, who will eventually buy them back. Our affiliated company, AnnieMac Home Mortgage, is a mortgage lender.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Who makes the offer to the seller? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>You’ll work with your agent to make, negotiate, and finalize the offer with the seller. Your dedicated Home Purchase Coordinator will assist and ensure the offer meets the terms of the approval.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Who orders the inspection? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>This will be your home and you are responsible for ordering the inspection and reviewing the inspection results.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Why are there two contracts for Buy Now, Sell Later? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>With Buy Now, Sell Later, there are two transactions. First, AnnieMac Cash2Keys purchases the home for you, and you take possession. After you sell your old home, you buy the home from Cash2Key. A purchase contract is required for each transaction.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What is the closing date of the contract between Cash2Keys and me? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>The closing date is written as on or before 6 months from the current date. The closing date is often much quicker than 6 months, and AnnieMac will close sale with you as soon as you are ready.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Cash2Keys closed on my new home! Now what? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>You’ll take possession as soon as we close on it and transfer the utilities into your name. Your agent will collect your new keys from the listing agent and give them to you.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What is a conditional purchase price? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>When you choose to Buy Now, Sell Later, there will be a conditional purchase price. The purchase price is conditional because if you sell or get under contract for a higher price within 180 days, you are entitled to sell for the highest price and best terms offered to you. In the rare instance where you do not receive a higher offer, AnnieMac Cash2Keys will purchase your old home after 180 days to ensure you can purchase your new home.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>How do you arrive at the conditional purchase price? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>We typically have an interior broker price opinion completed and perform an analysis of home sales and listings in the market. The conditional purchase price is typically 91% - 95% of the home’s market value, minus a 6% real estate sales commission that will be paid when the home is resold.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Does AnnieMac Cash2Keys work with agents? Can the buyer choose their own? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Real Estate agents expertly advocate for their clients in buying and selling. AnnieMac Cash2Keys requires the borrower to work with an agent. Choosing an agent is an important and personal decision that should be made by the buyer.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What does AnnieMac Private Equity Cash2Keys do? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>We enable you to make your client a cash buyer.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What clients would benefit from AnnieMac Cash2Key’s services? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>AnnieMac Cash2Keys can turn your client’s financed offer into a cash offer.
						
						If your client would have a home sale contingency, a Buy Now, Sell Later pre-approval allows them to buy first with a cash offer. This transforms a complicated, contingency-filled offer likely involving a stay in temporary housing intoto a quick close cash offer that will allow them to move seamlessly.
						
						Clients not selling a home will be more likely to have their offer accepted with our Cash Offer program. A Cash Offer is prioritized by sellers and listing agents because the EMD is non-refundable and closing guaranteed after the due diligence period.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What does my client need in order to qualify for an AnnieMac Cash Offer? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Any client that may benefit from Cash Offer or Buy Now, Sell Later must submit a pre-approval request several days in advance so that there is adequate time to review their qualifications. Your client must be pre-approved with AnnieMac Home Mortgage before AnnieMac Cash2Keys will submit an offer on their behalf.</p>
				</details>
				<!-- <details class="">
					<summary>How do I register my client so they can submit a Cash Offer or Buy Now, Sell Later pre-approval? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Register them here (hyperlink?). AnnieMac will contact them to complete an application and collect the documents necessary for the pre-approval.</p>
				</details> -->
				<details class="">
					<summary>What are the steps involved in a Cash Offer? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>These are the main steps in a Cash Offer transaction:
						
						Get pre-approved. The client will work with AnnieMac Home Mortgage to submit their income and asset documentation for a full review. If they are pre-approved, they are assigned a Home Purchase Coordinator that will work with you and your client.
						
						Cash Offer Agreement. Your Home Purchase Coordinator will discuss the steps and what is required of your client upfront. They will give your client this information in writing, and there will be an agreement with AnnieMac Cash2Keys to submit a cash offer on your client’s behalf, with you as their agent.
						
						Make a cash offer. Find the home they’ll love. You and the Cash2Keys Home Purchase Coordinator will spring into agent to draft and submit the cash offer. Based on how quickly the client wants to close, you will decide whether to have the purchase contract assignable to your client or have Cash2Keys do a quick closing and later resell the property to the client.
						
						Secure the home. When the seller accepts the offer, you and the client can arrange for the home to be inspected and the property appraised. The client will submit the earnest money deposit (3% of the purchase price) on a primary residence) and review your home inspection.
						
						Close on the new home. If you and the client elected to have the purchase contract assignable, the mortgage will be processed and the client will close on your new home, backed by an AnnieMac Cash Offer. Your real estate commission will be paid in this transaction.
						
						The client buys back their new home. If you elected to use the Cash2Keys Quick Close to meet a seller’s request for a quick close, the client will buy their new home from Cash2Keys as soon as their mortgage is ready. In states that charge a real estate transfer tax, the client will be required to pay all the transfer taxes for this transaction. In this scenario, your real estate commission will be paid at this second transaction rather than the first to Cash2Key.
					</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>What are the steps in the Buy Now, Sell Later Process? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>These are the main steps in a Buy Now, Sell Later transaction
						
						Pre-approval. To be eligible for Buy Now, Sell Later, the client and their current residence must be pre-approved. This starts with registering here (hyperlink?). AnnieMac then contacts the client to conduct the pre-approval, which takes several days. If they are pre-approved with Buy Now, Sell Later, a Home Purchase Coordinator is assigned to work with you and your client.
						
						Buy Now, Sell Later Agreement. Your Home Purchase Coordinator will discuss the steps and what is required of the client upfront. They will give information in writing, and there will be a Buy Now, Sell Later agreement with AnnieMac Cash2Keys to submit a cash offer on your client’s behalf. This agreement will also contain a conditional purchase price to buy their current residence in 181 days if you and they do not sell it sooner.
						
						Make a cash offer. Find the home they’ll love. When you do, you and the Cash2Keys Home Purchase Coordinator will draft and submit the cash offer.
						
						Secure their home. When the seller accepts the offer, you and the buyer can arrange for the home to be inspected and the property appraised.
						
						Cash2Keys close. AnnieMac Cash2Keys will close on the new home. When they do, your client takes possession and can move in right away. The rental period begins the day Cash2Keys closes. You will be paid commission when the buyer settles, not at this closing where Cash2Keys settles.
						
						List their old home for sale. Maybe the home needed some touch up or staging to maximize the sale price. With two weeks from the Cash2Keys close to list their home for sale, there is just enough time to get the property looking right so that buyers bid aggressively.
						
						Closing sale on the old home and buy back of the new one. When their old home sells, the client is ready to complete the purchase. In the unlikely event that their old home did not sell in 180 days, Cash2Keys will purchase it according to the terms of the conditional purchase price. In states that charge a real estate transfer tax, the client will be required to pay all the transfer taxes for this final transaction.  You will be paid the real estate commission for this second transaction.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>When is there two transactions instead of one? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Buy Now, Sell Later always involves two transactions. Cash2Keys closes on the property followed by your client closing on the property.
					
					With Cash Offer, there is just one transaction when the purchase contract is assigned. This is helpful in states that charge a transfer tax to avoid unnecessary costs to the client.
					
					When there is no assignment of contract with Cash Offer, there are two transactions: the Cash2Keys closing and your client’s closing. This can be helpful when the bidding is frenzied on the property because your client can offer a closing in as little as two weeks.
					</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Who represents AnnieMac Private Equity Cash2Keys in the transaction? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>You do. The broker buyer agreement will reflect that you represent the buyer and AnnieMac Cash2Key. In the transactions where there are two closings instead of one, you will be paid for the second transaction and not the first transaction. When there is only one transaction, you will be paid for that transaction.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Can I still represent my client on the sale side too? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Yes. You will have 180 days to represent them as the listing agent. After the 180th day, they will sell to AnnieMac Cash2Keys for the conditional purchase price. When priced appropriately, the home should sell well within the 180-day window.</p>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Who is the Home Purchase Coordinator and what do they do? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>The Home Purchase Coordinator works for AnnieMac Cash2Keys and is a specialist in Cash Offer and Buy Now, Sell Later. Your transaction is assigned a dedicated Home Purchase Coordinator and you may speak with a different Home Purchase Coordinator if your dedicated HPC is unavailable. The HPC is there to educate your client and yourself on Cash Offer or Buy Now, Sell Later. They communicate the steps of the transaction to your client, let them know what is required of them, and help you structure the contracts within the bounds of Cash Offer or Buy Now, Sell Later. HPC does not work on your client’s mortgage, so their Loan Officer and Processor are the best points of contact for mortgage-related matters.</p>

					<summary>What if my buyer doesn’t fulfill the contract and purchase the home? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Cash2Keys purchases the property for the sole intent of reserving it for your client. If the buyer defaults on the contract, Cash2Keys will retain the buyer agent commission, buyer EMD, and Cash Offer fee to cover the costs of reselling the home. Any rent accrued would be immediately due.</p>

					<summary>How much does it cost? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Your client will pay a Cash Offer fee in addition to their earnest money deposit. Typically, the Cash Offer fee and the earnest money combined total 3% of the purchase price. If they use AnnieMac Home Mortgage and Community Title, the Cash Offer fee is refunded to them in full. Using a title company familiar with the process for both transactions also makes the process simpler.</p>

				<details class="">
					<summary>When does my client pay the fee? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>Your client pays the earnest money deposit and Cash Offer fee after the seller accepts the offer, typically within 3 days.</p>

					<summary>If my client takes advantage of Buy Now, Sell Later, how is their rent calculated? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<p>The rental lease period begins when AnnieMac Cash2Keys closes on the purchase of their new home. Rental rates total about the same as a mortgage, taxes, and insurance on the property. Rent is accrued but not paid until the sale of their old home closes, so they never need to make two house payments.</p>
