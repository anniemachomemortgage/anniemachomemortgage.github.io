							<h2>Close on More Homes with Cash</h2>
							<p>Is the competitive housing market slowing down your success?  When demand for housing outpaces the supply of available homes for sale, home hunting becomes a fierce competition for you and your clients.</p>
							<p>At AnnieMac Home Mortgage, we want your clients to have a fair shot at owning a home they will love. We also want your business to not only survive, but thrive.</p>
							<p>That's why we've partnered with AnnieMac Private Equity Cash2Keys to be able to offer two groundbreaking cash programs that give both new and existing homeowners a smooth, stress-free path to their ideal homes. With our help, your clients can snag the homes they want on their own terms, avoiding lots of contingencies and scheduling challenges along the way.</p>

							<h3>Cash Offer</h3>
							<p>Is your client a first-time home buyer? That fact alone might get their best offers ignored by homeowners, but just because they’re starting from scratch doesn’t mean they should give up on the home of their dreams – and that’s where this program evens the odds!  With the power of cash, they’ll call the shots while you retain full commission and watch your referrals go through the roof. Everybody wins!</p>

							<h3>Buy Now, Sell Later</h3>
							<p>Perfect for current homeowners! AnnieMac Private Equity buys the home so your clients can move right in while taking the time to comfortably sell their old house and maximize their profit by accepting the highest offer possible! Once they've sold their old property, AnnieMac Private Equity will sell their new home to them directly.  They get to move where and when they want, while you receive full commission and fantastic word-of-mouth that will help your business grow to heights you’ve only dreamt of!</p>

					<details class="">
						<summary> What is an AnnieMac Private Equity Cash Offer? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
						<div class="answer">
							<p>An AnnieMac Private Equity offer is a purchase contract backed by a cash offer. After a short due diligence period where you can have a home inspection and appraisal, the cash offer becomes non-refundable, and the seller knows that it will close. You may choose to have the purchase contract assigned to you so that you close as the buyer or have Cash2Keys close quickly and then sell the property to you for the same price.</p>

						<div class="answer">
