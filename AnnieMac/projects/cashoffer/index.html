						<h3>Cash Offer</h3>
						<p>Are you a first-time home buyer? That fact alone might get your best offers ignored by homeowners, but just because you’re starting from scratch doesn’t mean you should give up on the home of your dreams – and that’s where this program evens the odds!</p>

					<summary> What is an AnnieMac Cash2Keys Cash Offer? <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<div class="answer"><p>A Cash2Keys offer is a purchase contract backed by a cash offer. After a short due diligence period where you can have a home inspection and appraisal, the cash offer becomes non-refundable, and the seller knows that it will close. You may choose to have the purchase contract assigned to you so that you close as the buyer or have Cash2Keys close quickly and then sell the property to you for the same price.</p></div>
				</details>
				<details class="">
					<summary>Why are Cash Offers better than an offer with mortgage financing <i class="fas fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></summary>
					<div class="answer"><p>Sellers love cash offers and prefer them to financed offers. With an AnnieMac Cash2Keys Cash Offer, the seller knows that after the due diligence period the transaction is sure to close based on the terms of the offer and the backing of AnnieMac Private Equity Cash2Key.</p></div>
