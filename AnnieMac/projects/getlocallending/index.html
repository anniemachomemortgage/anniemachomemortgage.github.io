									<h3>About Sam</h3>
									<p>Sam Borthwick is a local mortgage expert from Washington who has helped thousands of families across the state realize their dreams of home ownership.</p>
									<p>“My background was in finance, but I always wanted to take more of an educational role. When I got into the Mortgage Industry I realized there was a huge void in the educational side of the home buying process. Each one of my consults focuses on educating you on your options so you KNOW you have made the right decision. Over the years I have been blessed to be able to create custom game plans for my clients from paying off their homes in under 10 years to planning for retirement, or creating wealth through passive income from rental properties. Choosing a mortgage is the single biggest lever you can pull so important to pull the right one.”</p>
									<p>In the fall 2017 He opened his first branch with Get Local Lending and built a team around the single purpose of educating buyers, sellers and investors on the best way to accomplish their goals. His team quickly became one of the highest recommended mortgage lenders in the area by focusing on the single most important part of this industry... YOU!</p>

										<h3>The Conventional Loan</h3>
										<p>When you think of a mortgage, you are probably thinking about a conventional loan. Conventional loans are what you would categorize as a ‘standard’ mortgage or home loan. Typically, these have a few tighter requirements for the borrower, but are less strict on the property unlike you would see with a FHA or VA loan and most lenders will offer them. Credit requirements can range as low as a 640 credit score, and there are programs at times where you can qualify with down payments as low as 3% down. The programs vary at different times, but here at Get Local Lending, we are proud to offer some of the most competitive options out there.</p>
										<p>Because they are so widely available, and the low interest rates being offered, conventional loans are some of the most popular options and most used mortgage products in the US.</p>
										<h4>Conventional loan requirements</h4>
										<p>Conventional loan requirements can range depending on the program that fits your needs. Keep in mind though, conventional loans have guidelines that are set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These guidelines will set minimum standards like a 640 credit score, a debt to income ratio that is less than 49%, and as low as 3% down payment.</p>
										<p>It’s important to keep in mind that the more you are qualified, (better credit score and larger down payment), the better your interest rate and lower down payment. At Get Local Lending, we don’t just fill out paperwork to get our clients a mortgage, we want to do the initial legwork to get you positioned to get the best loan and rates available! It’s important to keep in mind that different programs will have different requirements for conventional loans, so we will work to find the mortgage that fits your needs.</p>
										<h4>Typical conventional loan down payments</h4>
										<p>Bear in mind, mortgage programs change regularly, but this outline will give you a rough idea of what lenders are typically looking for as a down payment in different conventional loan programs:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Conventional 97 loan — as low as 3% down</li>
											<li>Fannie Mae HomeReady loan — as low as 3% down</li>
											<li>Freddie Mac Home Possible loan — as low as 3% down</li>
											<li>Conventional loan with PMI — 5% down</li>
											<li>Upfront MI (Single payment PMI) — 10% down</li>
											<li>Conventional loan without PMI — 20% down</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>Advantages of a conventional mortgage loan</h4>
										<p>Flexible repayment schedules. Conventional loans can come in 7,10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 year loans repayment schedules. Most of our clients stick with the 15 or 30 year repayment plans, but flexibility is great when considering the bigger picture of our client’s goals.</p>
										<p>Best long term loan. When it comes to overall cost, a conventional loan is typically the least expensive long term loan. However every situation is different, be sure to check with one of our experts to see if it’s a good fit for you.</p>

									<div class="blocked-sectional-half">
										<h3>The FHA Loan</h3>
										<p>An FHA loan is a government backed mortgage loan that is insured by the Federal Housing Authority (FHA). FHA loans have some advantages for certain clients based on where they are at in life and what their financial constraints are. Especially for homebuyers who don’t have a lot of money saved up for a big down payment on a home, the FHA program offers a lower minimum down payment (3.5%).</p>
										<p>Some important things to consider when applying for an FHA loan:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>The “12 month rule”. Typically, the FHA will want to see 12 solid and consecutive months of on time payments for all your financial obligations including rent or housing costs.</li>
											<li>Mortgage Insurance. The FHA will require mortgage insurance on almost all FHA backed loans (there are some rare exceptions).</li>
											<li>Down payments. An FHA loan requires a minimum down payment of 3.5% of the home’s value.</li>
											<li>Occupancy rules. If you apply for and receive an FHA loan, you have to occupy or reside in that property.</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>FHA Loan Requirements</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Credit. You have to have at least a 620 credit score to qualify for a 3.5% down payment</li>
											<li>Less than perfect credit. A lower than 620 credit score will not necessarily preclude you from an FHA program, but you will have to come up with a higher down payment or at least 3 months reserves (total monthly mortgage payment X 3)
												Debt to income. Your debt to income ratio needs to be less than 50%. Make sure you have those credit card and revolving lines of credit paid down!</li>
											<li>Mortgage Insurance. Mortgage insurance (MIP) is a requirement.</li>
											<li>Employment. You must be able to prove your employment and income.</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>Three common ways to use an FHA loan:</h4>
										<p>While FHA loans are easier to qualify for initially, they are more expensive in the long run, That is why we always create a game plan to get you into a better loan option down the road.</p>
										<h4>FHA Home Loan: Buy Your First Home</h4>
										<p>FHA home loans are not just for a certain type of buyer or specifically whether or not a client has owned real estate before. But, first time home buyers can definitely benefit from the FHA loan down payment requirements and FHA loans can typically be more flexible on credit requirements compared to more conventional mortgages. Sometimes you can combine first time home buyer incentives with the FHA loan program to really create an ideal mortgage for a first time home buyer depending on the available programs. For the record, FHA itself offers no first-time home buyer incentive.</p>
										<h4>FHA Home Loan: Buy A Second Home</h4>
										<p>In some scenarios, it’s possible for an FHA loan customer to own an existing property and apply for a new FHA mortgage to purchase a new home. Bear in mind though, if you use an FHA loan to purchase another home, that home has to be your primary residence and not used as a vacation home or for a commercial purpose like a bed and breakfast. An interesting way to use an FHA loan does allow you to purchase a residence that has up to four living units, as long as you live in one of the units. Great for new investors!</p>
										<h4>FHA Home Loan: Refinance Your Existing Mortgage</h4>
										<p>Sometimes refinancing into an FHA loan offers advantages to clients who need to do what we call a “rehab loan” or an FHA 203(K) loan. This kind of loan will typically include funds for upgrades and rehabs to a property.</p>
										<p>FHA 203(k) rehab loans can be approved with an FHA Energy Efficient Mortgage option to add more funds to the loan for approved energy-efficient upgrades or improvements.</p>
										<p>If you have an existing FHA mortgage, you might have an option to refinance and lower your monthly payments or existing interest rates. A streamline loan will typically not have an FHA required credit check or a requirement for a new appraisal.</p>
										<p>FHA Streamline refinance loans have to, by the rules of the loan program, offer a benefit to the borrower like a lower interest rate, lower payments, or refinancing out of an Adjustable Rate Mortgage into a fixed rate.</p>

We want you to know that we care and are committed to making sure you get to take advantage of all the benefits that come with the VA loan program.</p>
										<p>A VA loan is a mortgage guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) but it is issued by a private lender, like a bank or mortgage company. VA loans come with advantages that can make it easier to buy a home because it usually doesn’t require a down payment. With a VA loan the lender has the assurance that, if the loan is not repaid, a portion of the loan amount will be repaid by the government. Because of this reduction in risk, it gives mortgage companies the ability to offer no down payment loans because of that government backing.</p>
										<h4>Who can get a VA loan?</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Active duty military or a veteran who meets the minimum requirements.</li>
											<li>You’re the surviving spouse of a service member who died while on active duty or from a service-connected disability and you have not remarried or remarried after age 57 or Dec. 16, 2003.</li>
											<li>While the VA itself does not have minimum requirements for a credit score to qualify for a VA loan, lenders will have a minimum requirement. We can guide you through this requirement.</li>
											<li>The property you want to buy has to pass a VA inspection.</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>VA Loan Benefits:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>No down payment.</li>
											<li>Great interest rates. In general, VA loans have lower interest rates than FHA or conventional loans.</li>
											<li>Lower closing costs. With a VA loan, you have the assurance that you will not pay too much in fees, as they are limited by the VA.</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>VA Loan Disadvantages:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>While you don’t have mortgage insurance that can sometimes be charged on a mortgage, you DO have a VA “funding fee”. This fee can get wrapped into your loan, but it is something to consider and keep in mind, especially on those more expensive homes or properties.</li>
											<li>First time use of your loan the funding fee will be 2.30% of your loan amount, subsequent use will be 3.60%
												However if you are more than 10% disabled from a service related injury, The VA will waive your funding fee.</li>
											<li>You cannot use a VA loan for a second home or an investment property. They are limited to only primary residence loans.</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>The USDA Loan</h3>
										<p>Income-qualified borrowers looking to get loans on homes in U.S. Department of Agriculture-approved rural areas can enjoy a number of benefits through this government-insured loan program. They include no down payment, low interest rates and flexible underwriting guidelines.</p>
										<p>The United States Department of Agriculture developed this mortgage option to improve the economy and quality of life in rural America by encouraging the purchasing of rural land. USDA loans are issued through the USDA Rural Development Guaranteed Housing Loan Program, and you might be surprised how feasible it is to qualify for one beyond what most would consider “farmland”.</p>
										<h4>Why would a USDA Loan be the best choice for you?</h4>
										<p><strong>Availability</strong> – Contrary to their name, USDA Rural Development home loans are not exclusively for agricultural areas, or even for places far out in the country.</p>
										<p><strong>No Down Payments</strong> – A USDA loan is one of the only loan programs offered to the general public that allows you to finance 100% of your home’s value. That means no down payment of any kind!</p>
										<p><strong>Rolled-in Closing Costs</strong> – A USDA loan is the only loan type on the market that allows you to finance your closing costs up to the appraised value.</p>
										<p><strong>Long-Term Stability</strong> – For income-qualified borrowers, USDA’s provide competitive Fixed Interest Rates at Affordable 30-Year Terms.</p>
										<h4>What are the qualifications for an USDA Loan?</h4>
										<p>For starters, you will need proof of US citizenship or permanent residency. Your intended property purchase must serve as a primary residence within a qualified rural area.</p>
										<h4>Credit Criteria</h4>
										<p>You should carry good credit (typically a score of 640 or greater) to be eligible for the USDA’s automated underwriting system. It is still possible to qualify for manual underwriting with a lower credit score, although you may be held to more stringent guidelines.</p>
										<h4>Income Requirements</h4>
										<p>Your adjusted household income is equal to or less than 115% of the area median income.</p>
										<h4>Loan Limitations</h4>
										<p>You can apply for a USDA Loan for up to a $453,100 purchase price.</p>

										<h3>Refinancing Your Loan</h3>
										<p>If you need help gaining clarity as to whether or not a refinance of your existing mortgage is right for you, please call us so we can have a real conversation about where you are and what your goals are for a mortgage. There is a lot to consider and there can be wrong information out there that can make things all the more complicated. There are more things to consider when you are looking at a refinance besides just a drop in interest rates. We guide our clients to consider both their long and short term situations when considering a refinance.</p>
										<p>There are different reasons to consider a refinance of an existing mortgage.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Re amortize current debt. If you have had a few credit cards rack up, or maybe you finally want to pay off those pesky student loans. Using your home’s equity and locking in a low fixed rate can sometimes free up much needed cash flow. Each case is different. We will discover if this is a good option for you during a consult.</li>
											<li>Cut monthly payments. Lower interest rates = lower monthly payments. Depending on where you are in your loan and in your life, it can be beneficial to refinance a loan depending on how much of a break you can get on your interest rate.</li>
											<li>Additions or remodels. Need to remodel an old kitchen or bathroom or add on a room because your family grew? There are benefits to consider when thinking about a refi of your mortgage as opposed to financing those types of home renovations outside of your mortgage.</li>
											<li>Changing loan terms. There are many different terms for your mortgage. Picking one that suits your long and short terms goals is always helpful. But if things change, we can always reassess what term works for you and your circumstances.</li>
											<li>Switching loan types. Sometimes due to circumstances out of your control you may have had to choose a higher cost/lower requirement loan to purchase your home. Now may be a good time to discuss the option of refinancing into a different loan type that ultimately lowers your costs from interest rates and lower mortgage payments.</li>

						<h3>First Time Home Buyer</h3>
						<p>Buying a home can be challenging for a first-time home buyer, and at Get Local Lending, we want to be your resource to guide you through this exciting and sometimes, challenging process. Buying a home for the first time can be overwhelming because there is a lot to it, but the team here at Get Local Lending will walk you through each step to make it easy and understandable. There is something great about being a first time home buyer – it comes with some unique advantages! By design, first time home buyers are needed in our real estate market to encourage growth in our communities. We will simplify the mortgage process and help position you with your home loan for a successful real estate experience.</p>
						<h4>What qualifies you as a first time home buyer?</h4>
						<p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the authority on defining a first time home buyer, defines the first time home buyer as anyone who meets these criteria:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Someone who has not owned a principal residence for at least three years. An interesting caveat to that is if you have owned a home but your spouse hasn’t, then potentially you may qualify for a first time home buyer program.</li>
							<li>If you are a single parent who only owned a home with a former spouse while you were married.</li>
							<li>Someone who has only owned a principal residence that was not attached to a permanent foundation, (mobile home).</li>
							<li>If you owned a property that fell out of compliance with building codes, and it cannot be brought back up to code, you may qualify for a first time home buyer program.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>It’s important to note that there are multiple First Time Home Buyer programs available. Don’t let a mortgage company push you into a program. Every home and every home buyer is a little different, and based on your needs there might be a program that fits what you are trying to accomplish with your home purchase. At Get Local Lending, while we utilize technology to get our clients where they want to go, we still believe in knowing what our clients are trying to achieve.</p>
						<p>When you are getting a mortgage, lenders look for proof and documentation. Want to be prepared and grease the wheels on your mortgage process? Preparation is key!</p>
						<h4>Pay off debt.</h4>
						<p>Lenders don’t typically want to lend to borrowers who have over 30% of their income going out on revolving credit cards or debt. Focus on paying off debt that will as quickly as possible get you at or below that 30% mark.</p>
						<h4>Taxes.</h4>
						<p>If you have ANY tax issues hanging out there, let’s get that handled! Taxes are a big deal and lenders don’t like to give mortgages to any borrower where there are leftover tax issues. If you need help with this, let us know. We have resources and experts who can help.</p>
						<h4>Avoid any big purchases.</h4>
						<p>We have seen borrowers get approved for a mortgage, only to not have their loan close because the borrower got over confident. DON’T MAKE ANY LARGE PURCHASE UNTIL AFTER YOUR LOAN IS CLOSED. What do you want more – the new BMW, boat……… or your new home?</p>
						<h4>Prepare your documents.</h4>
						<p>Get all of these documents ready. If you can get all of these documents before you even fill out your mortgage application, you will be that much more prepared. You want to position all of your documents to be as complete as possible so you don’t give lenders anything else to ask for.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Tax returns. The past two years of your tax returns. Include all of the documents that you included with your tax return.</li>
							<li>Pay stubs. Gather anything that will help a lender see proof of your income. Pay stubs from at least your last two months of pay is a great place to start. If you’re self employed, send in 1099 forms and bank statements (annual bank statements and the last two months).</li>
							<li>Bank statements. Get copies of your bank statements (most of these can be gathered online now) that show the last three months of your banking. Include savings accounts and any other assets like investments and 401k statements. This will show a lender that you have the means to pay your mortgage.</li>
							<li>Gift letters. Sometimes parents or grandparents will help a family member out with money for a down payment or help with the costs of purchasing a home. This is great, but a lender will want to know that money is a gift and not something that you have to pay back.</li>
							<li>Picture ID. We’ll need to prove that you are who you say you are and that you are the one(s) who filled out the mortgage application. We’ll need copies of your picture ID.</li>
							<li>Renting history. If you are a first time home buyer, sometimes lenders will want proof of your rental history. This might be proof of cancelled checks to your landlord or a letter from your landlord.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Some programs need more documentation and some need less, but the more prepared you are out of the gates, the better and easier the process will be.</p>

						<h3>Loans for Business Owners</h3>
						<p>At Get Local Lending we understand the challenges that a business owner may face when trying to jump through the hoops of getting a mortgage – it can be challenging and irritating. If you own a business there is a really good chance that you are taking full advantage of the legal tax deductions and write offs that the IRS allows for business owners. BUT, often taking advantage of those write offs that are allowed means that a business owner will show a lower net income and sometimes they will show a loss on their tax returns.</p>
						<p>While there are definitely more “hoops” to jump through when getting a mortgage if you are self employed, it can be done! At Get Local Lending, we have the team and expertise to bring clarity and honesty to your mortgage needs as a business owner.</p>
						<h4>Just like with any mortgage, we need to show:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>A good credit history.</li>
							<li>A clear snapshot of your financial picture (bank and financial statements).</li>
							<li>A solid picture of your business’s history.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>What you should really mentally prepare for is that lenders will want to see a full and clear picture of your financial self and at times, it may feel intrusive, but it is a necessary part of getting a mortgage when you get to take advantage of the trade offs that come with owning a business.</p>
						<p>What lenders want to see when giving mortgages to business owners.</p>
						<p>Just like any other mortgage loan program, lenders will want to see documentation. The more prepared you are with that documentation coming out of the gates, the easier and smoother your loan process will be. Here’s some of the basic things to have ready to go from day one:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Two years of federal income tax returns for BOTH your personal and business tax returns.</li>
							<li>Two months of your latest bank statements.</li>
							<li>A year to date profit and loss statement showing revenues, profits & losses.</li>
							<li>A copy of your business license and any legal documentation related to your business formation.</li>
							<li>Some kind of proof that you have been in business for at least two years. Ideally a letter from your CPA or accountant is best.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Some loan programs need less documentation, but the more information you can show a lender, the better we will be and the easier we will be able to position and close your loan.</p>
