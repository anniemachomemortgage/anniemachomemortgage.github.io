<h3>Tips for Selling Your Home Around Thanksgiving</h3>
<p>Most people believe that the best time to sell a home is in the summer months. This is not entirely true. There are far less homes for sale during the holiday season which makes the demand for quality homes much higher.</p>
<p>If you want to sell your home quickly and at a good price, consider selling your home around Thanksgiving and during the winter holiday season. Here are some tips for selling your home during this time of year.</p>
<h4>Work on Your Curb Appeal</h4>
<p>Once November starts, trees start losing their leaves and it may be time to spruce up your curb appeal, including your front and back yard. If you are trying to sell your home during the fall months, it is important to make curb appeal a priority. Touch up the paint on your house, clean the gutters, and spruce up your front and back yard. Keep buyers’ safety in mind as well by ensuring that your sidewalks and steps are free of leaves. To further spruce up your curb appeal, consider putting out some fall arrangements such as mums and marigolds to give the front of your yard some fall color.</p>
<h4>Fall Cleaning</h4>
<p>After the summer months come to an end, it is time to do a fall cleaning and declutter your home to make it appealing to buyers. Eliminating clutter is a great way to make your home stand out from the rest. It shows that you put effort into the way your home looks and care about its’ maintenance. Here are some ways to declutter your home before putting it on the market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean up your closets – sort through clothes, accessories, and shoes.</li>  
<li>Tidy-up all paperwork and magazines/newspapers.</li> 
<li>Get rid of excess furniture.</li>  
<li>Depersonalize your home.</li>  
<li>Tidy drawers and cupboards.</li> 
<li>Organize your garage.</li>   
</ul>
<h4>Create a Warm Atmosphere</h4>
<p>Creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere is very important when selling your home around Thanksgiving. Potential buyers like to envision themselves living in the home during the holidays so make sure your home is tastefully decorated with warm colors and neutral decorations. Add fall colors to your home with fall accent pillows, throws, and table décor. It is also helpful to have some hot apple cider or a tray of pumpkin muffins available during a home showing. This will entice buyers and make them feel at home.</p>
<h4>Adequately Price Your Home</h4>
<p>Correctly pricing your home during the holidays is very important. The majority of buyers who are looking for a home during the holidays, will purchase around Thanksgiving to ensure that they have a home to celebrate December holidays in. Make sure your home is priced attractively and appropriately for the area and current market. Closing on a home during this season will also allow you to write off closing costs on this year’s tax season.</p>
<h4>Choose the Right Agent</h4>
<p>No matter what time of year you choose to put your house on the market, deciding on the right agent is a very important decision. It is helpful to choose an agent that has experience selling homes during the holiday months and has a good reputation in the community. Selling your home during the holiday season can be more challenging, but with the right agent, it can be done quickly and efficiently.</p>
