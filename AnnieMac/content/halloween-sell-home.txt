<h4>Halloween Open House</h4>
<p>Holding an open house is a great marketing tool to help sell your home quickly and efficiently. This is a fun and seasonally-appropriate way to show off your home and attract prospective buyers. Decorate the interior of your home with Halloween themed decorations that are tasteful and welcoming. Host your Halloween themed open house a few weekends before Halloween to bring in as many potential buyers as possible. Invite your family, friends, and neighbors for food, drinks, and Halloween themed activities. Activities include pumpkin painting or a Halloween costume contest. You are sure to attract buyers with this unique type of open house.</p> 
<h4>Trick-or-Treating Marketing Techniques</h4>
<p>Trick-or-treaters make for a great opportunity to promote your home. Halloween is one of the only times where people walk door-to-door; use this as a way to market your home and all that it has to offer. To promote your home during trick-or-treating, try printing out small cards with a message saying that your home is for sale and attach it to the candy you hand out. Make sure to include all relevant information including your address and your agent’s content information. You can also post fliers near your front door so that parents can take one when they bring their kids to the door to get the candy.</p> 
<p>Halloween can be the best time to sell your home if you take the time to decorate properly and market correctly. Keep it professional and stay away from decorations that may scare people away. If you are unsure about how to decorate tastefully, talk to your real estate professional for tips and advice.</p>
