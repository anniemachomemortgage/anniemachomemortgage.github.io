<p>Is the most wonderful time of the year also a wonderful time to sell your home? Turns out, it actually is. Warmer months are normally the best time to sell, but that is not true for every property. If you are interested in putting your home on the market during the holiday season, do not fear the rumors. Holiday season may be the best and most financially promising time for some home sellers. Here are some reasons to put your home on the market right now.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Less Competition</strong> - during the holiday season, buyers have fewer homes to choose from because many sellers wait for the spring to list their house. This makes it easier to sell your home because motivated buyers do not have many houses to look at.</li>
	<li><strong>Serious Buyers</strong> - winter buyers are normally more motivated due to a time sensitive move and have an immediate need to purchase a home.</li>
	<li><strong>Well-Decorated</strong> - your home looks its best during the holiday season, especially if you put the time and energy into tastefully decorating your home. Buyers like to envision themselves living in the home during the holidays, so creating a welcoming and decorated atmosphere is helpful when selling your home.</li>
	<li><strong>Higher Profit</strong> - because there are fewer homes for sale during the holiday season, homes sold during this time tend to sell for a higher price.</li>
	<li><strong>Better Position to Buy</strong> - when you sell at the end of the year, you are in a better position to buy in the springtime when more houses are for sale. Buyers will also be able to buy quickly instead of waiting on a home sale contingency.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Holiday Season Selling Tips</h3>
<p><strong>Consider listing your home just after a major holiday.</strong> Without the stress of the holiday, buyers can focus on the real task at hand: buying a new home.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing is key.</strong> When selling during the holiday season, you want to discuss with your agent an appropriate selling price. Buyers are motivated during this season and are willing to pay a little more for a quality house.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare for a showing.</strong> When a showing is scheduled, prepare your home with seasonal treats and decorations that make your home feel welcoming.</p>
