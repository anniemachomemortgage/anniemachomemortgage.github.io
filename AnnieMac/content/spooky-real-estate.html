<h3>Spooky Real Estate: Buying and Selling a Haunted House</h3>
<p>Halloween is just around the corner. There is no better time to talk about buying and selling haunted houses. It may be spooky season, but that does not mean that selling real estate should be scary too.</p>
<h4>How to Sell a Haunted House</h4>
<p>Fortunately for current homeowners and real estate agents, if you have a house that you or your community believes is haunted, there are some steps you can take to increase your selling potential.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Don’t Let the Law Scare You</strong> – If you think your home is haunted, talk this over with your real estate agent and get informed on the laws in your state regarding past horror experiences or extraordinary occurrences in the home or on the property. There are two common laws that, depending on what your state abides by, homeowners and real estate agents may need to follow: 
		<li>1) You may be legally required to say something about your haunted house and be subject to a possible lawsuit down the road if you do not.</li> 
		<li>2) You may be able to say or do absolutely nothing.</li>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Shut Down the Rumors</strong> – If everyone thinks your house is haunted but you know your house is not, this is considered a psychologically impacted or stigmatized home. Come up with a plan for how to deal with rumors regarding your house and always shut them down when they are brought up by the public. </li>
	<li><strong>Lower Your Price</strong> – If the selling of your home is severely impacted by the haunted aspects of the house, you may need to bring the price down to make it attractive for an investor who will ultimately scrap the house and build a new one.</li>
<h4>Why Buying a Haunted House is A Good Investment</h4>
<p>If you are in the market for a home, do not stray away from ones that have the potential to be haunted. Most homes that are thought to be haunted are usually just victims of rumors spread by the local community. If you are interested in a home that is believed to be haunted, give it a chance before immediately deciding against it.  Here are some reasons why you should consider buying a haunted house:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>Money Will Be Saved: If a house is considered haunted, it is also considered stigmatized in the real estate industry. This means that you will not pay top price for the property. Unnatural deaths and hauntings usually drop a home’s price by at least 20 percent.</li>
	<li>Haunted History – if you are a historian or interested in spooky events, buying a haunted house is a perfect space for you. Homes like these also make for interesting research projects and are a great way to get to know your neighbors when researching its history.</li> 
</ul>
<p>The best kind of real estate agent will see your haunted house as a welcomed challenge rather than an immediate denial of representation. No matter your homes history, with the right marketing and promotional plan, your home can be sold as fast as the new house downtown without the frightening tenants.</p>
