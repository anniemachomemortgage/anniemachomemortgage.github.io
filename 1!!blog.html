<h3>Questions to Ask on a Home Tour</h3>
<p>When it comes time to tour houses during your homebuying process, it is important to develop a list of questions to ask the listing agent while attending either a private home tour or an open house. Asking the right questions will ensure that you know important information about the home, including the sellers motivation for selling and other valuable information that may not be on the listing.</p>
<p>Before you attend a home tour or open house, create a list of questions that you want answered about the property. When talking to the seller's agent, be sure not to give away too much information about your homebuying goals or financial situation, as this is for your agent to know and not the seller's.</p>
<p>Here are some questions that you will want to ask when viewing a home:</p>
<h4>Why is this house for sale?</h4>
<p>Knowing the reason why homeowners are selling can provide you with important information. It can inform you of potential issues with the home or if the seller is pressed for time, which could benefit you if you submit a quick offer.</p>
<h4>How long has the home been on the market?</h4>
<p>When you are considering putting an offer on a home, it is crucial to know how long it has been on the market. A home that has been on the market for a while could prove that there is something wrong with the home that the seller either hasn't disclosed or there is something that they are not willing to negotiate on. Also, if the home has been on the market for a long time, buyers have an upper hand when negotiating with the seller and may be able to offer a lower price than asking.</p>
<h4>Are there current offers on the home?</h4>
<p>When viewing homes, it can be helpful to know if there are other buyers interested. If you know you are bidding against other buyers, you can place a higher bid on the home in the hopes the seller will accept.</p>
<h4>Are there any structural issues?</h4>
<p>This is a crucial question to ask during a home tour. Sellers are required to disclose any structural issues, but it is helpful to request an official seller's disclosure from the seller's agent. Knowing these specific issues will allow you to ask other questions regarding structural problems.</p>
<h4>Have any updates been made on the home?</h4>
<p>Before you put an offer on a home, you will want to know when the sellers made any updates to the major systems and features of the home. This may include updates to the roof, siding, electrical systems, heating and air conditioning, and water heater. This will give you a good idea of what repairs and replacements you will have to do if you end up buying the house.</p>
<h4>What is included with the home sale?</h4>
<p>When you are touring a home, everything you see inside the house is not necessarily included in the sale of the home. Always be sure to ask what the seller is including in the sale or what they would be willing to include. Asking this question will determine if the home is move-in ready or if you will need to buy appliances and furniture.</p>
<h4>Is the home attached to an HOA?</h4>
<p>It is important to ask the seller's agent if the home is attached to a homeowners association (HOA), which is common in suburban neighborhoods. HOA's come with rules, regulations, and fees for residents who live there, so it is best to know what you are getting into before you put an offer in on a home.</p>
<h4>How's the neighborhood?</h4>
<p>When you purchase a home, you are also committing to the local neighborhood. Ask the seller's agent about the surrounding neighborhood, its amenities, people who live there, and what businesses are in the area. If you have children, also ask about the school system and if there are parks/playgrounds nearby.</p>
<h4>Does the seller have a specific selling timeline?</h4>
<p>It is a good idea to find out if the seller has a certain timeline for when they want to sell their home. Sellers who want to move quickly may be open to negotiations. Sellers who are in no rush to move may wait until they get a great offer.</p>
<h4>Does the home have utilities and what do they cost?</h4>
<p>Ask the seller's agent if the home uses natural gas, solar energy, electricity, or a combination. You can also ask what the estimated monthly utility cost is to ensure you have enough money in your budget to afford the total amount the house will cost you each month.</p>
