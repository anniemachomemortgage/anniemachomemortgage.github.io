				<h4>About Clancy</h4>
				<p>I started my insurance sales career in 2002 with GMAC Insurance in St. Louis, MO.  From there I was able to spend some valuable time working auto and injury claims with General Motors as well. 
					<button class="more-toggle-button" id="toggle-Meyerhoeffer">Learn More</button>
				</p><div class="expanded-biography">After 5 years with GMAC I took a position with Fireman’s Fund Insurance and for the next 7 years I held various roles in sales and underwriting in St. Louis, Seattle, and Phoenix.  I was offered an opportunity to open my own insurance agency with Farmers Insurance back in St. Louis and I built and grew that to one of the top Farmers Agencies in the country in just 5 short years.  After selling my agency I decided to open a sales and marketing consulting company and that took me on a project to Virginia.  I spent 3 years in Virginia before relocating to Colorado and working in the medical transport insurance industry.  I am very happy that all of that led me to AnnieMac Insurance and I am very excited to have joined the team. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my two teenage sons camping, hiking, volunteering on ski patrol, fishing, wakeboarding, and traveling in our RV.</div>
