					<h3 class="rachel-sub-heading-2">About Me</h3>
					<p>Hi, I’m Rachael! I understand that the Yellow Brick Road to reaching your professional destination within the mortgage industry can be paved with many questions and concerns! That’s actually really common so if that’s you, you’re not alone. That’s why I’m here! I joined AnnieMac as a Business Development Manager, with an utmost desire to provide solutions, lead with value, build long-lasting relationships!</p>
					<p>I’m delighted walk you through the process to help make your dream come true! I would love to think of myself as a business development “fairy godmother” at AnnieMac! There’s that yellow brick road before you but picture AnnieMac as your Emerald City of mortgage companies. I’m there to stand beside you as you journey ahead.</p>
					<p>I fully understand that loan originators have a very stressful job and seem to work around the clock. Therefore, at AnnieMac we’ve created a structure that allows you to have more time for yourself and provide platforms that you can rely on!</p>
					<p>Remember how the Fairy Godmother delighted in a happy ending? That’s me! It’s my delight to provide you with a place where your goals and dreams come true.... all under one roof! If you’re searching for someone that is knowledgeable and compassionate in this field….you’ve found her! I invite you to reach out and connect with me because I’m enthusiastic to help you find your forever home as a loan officer! There’s no place like… AnnieMac!</p>
					<h3 class="rachel-sub-heading-2">Background</h3>
					<p>In my prior experience, I worked as an established Voiceover Actor, Vocal Coach, and Performer on a mission to inspire my listeners through the power of storytelling. Over the years, I had the privilege of working on many national projects for Amazon, PetSmart and Scholastic to name a few! I was also the owner and operator at Sing! Voice Studio for 11 years. I mentored and coached young singers and actors to achieve a higher level of success both personally and professionally.</p>
					<p>I also worked with CoreStates Capital Advisors, LLC as a media liaison and coordinator placing advisors on national television and radio programs including CNBC, Bloomberg TV &amp; Radio, The Wall Street Transcript, and USA Today.</p>
					<p>I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Communication Studies from Northeastern University, Boston. When I'm not in the studio, I love spending time with my two crazy kiddos, listening to audio books, playing tennis, serving as a worship leader at my church and singing and playing guitar with my hubby!</p>
