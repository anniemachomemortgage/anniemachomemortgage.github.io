				<h3>Cash Offer - Borrower</h3>
				<strong>What is an AnnieMac Cash2Key Cash Offer?</strong>
				<p>A Cash2Key offer is a purchase contract backed by a cash offer.  After a short due diligence period where you can have a home inspection and appraisal, the cash offer becomes non-refundable and the seller knows that it will close.  You may choose to have the purchase contract assigned to you so that you close as the buyer, or have Cash2Key close quickly and then sell the property to you for the same price.</p>
				<strong>Why are Cash Offer’s better than an offer with mortgage financing?</strong>
				<p>Sellers love cash offers and prefer them to financed offers.  With an AnnieMac Cash2Key Cash Offer, the seller knows that after the due diligence period the transaction is sure to close based on the terms of the offer and the backing of AnnieMac Private Equity Cash2Key.</p>

				<h3>Buy Now, Sell Later - Realtor</h3>
				<strong>What if I need to sell my home to buy another?</strong>
				<p>Buy Now, Sell Later, as the name states, allows you to turn this traditional requirement on its head and by before you sell.  AnnieMac Cash2Key will make a cash offer on your behalf and allow you to move in and rent immediately upon closing.  The rent is accrued but not immediately paid, so you will never have two housing payments.  After you have sold your old home, you will buy your new home back from Cash2Key.</p>
				<strong>What is the AnnieMac Cash2Key Buy Now, Sell Later program?</strong>
				<p>Buy Now, Sell Later allows eliminates the need to sell your home before you buy.  Instead of listing your home with nowhere to move, AnnieMac Cash2Key will make a cash offer on your behalf before you sell. When the offer is accepted and Cash2Key closes, you move into the property and accrue rent that you pay later, after you have sold your home. Buy and move first, then prep and stage your home to maximize your sale price.</p>
				<strong>Does AnnieMac Cash2Key purchase your current home?</strong>
				<p>Cash2Key wants you and your agent to sell your property to the highest offer.  For this reason, we allow you to move into your new home and have 2 weeks of preparation to make it shine for potential borrowers.  Cash2Key only purchases your old home as a last resort. If your home has not sold in 180 days, Cash2Key purchases your home for the established conditional purchase price so you can take title to your new home.</p>
				<strong>How much will the rent be on my home until I complete the purchase?</strong>
				<p>The rent will be approximately what mortgage, tax, and insurance payments will be on the property.  You will accrue rent from the day that AnnieMac Cash2Key purchases your property but will not pay the rent until you sell your home.  The rent will be pro-rated on a daily basis, so you won’t pay a full-months rent if you rent for less than the full month. The Buy Now, Sell Later agreement that you sign after pre-approval specifies your rental payment.</p>
				<strong>How do you determine how much equity I have in my home?</strong>
				<p>Typically, an interior BPO, broker price opinion, must be conducted on your current home.</p>
				<strong>Do I need renter’s insurance while I rent and before I buy?</strong>
				<p>You should strongly consider renter’s insurance.  Our insurance does not cover your personal property.</p>
				<strong>Are pets allow while you are renting?</strong>

				<p>You’ll take possession as soon as we close on it and transfer the utilities into your name.  Your agent will collect your new keys from the listing agent and give them to you.</p>
				<strong>What is a conditional purchase price?</strong>
				<p>When you choose to Buy Now, Sell Later, there will be a conditional purchase price.  The purchase price is conditional, because if you sell or get under contract for a higher price within 180 days, you are entitled to sell for the highest price and best terms offered to you. If the rare instance where you do not receive a higher offer, AnnieMac Cash2Key will purchase your old home after 180 days to ensure you can purchase your new home.</p>
				<strong>How do you arrive at the conditional purchase price?</strong>
				<p>We typically have an interior broker price opinion completed and perform an analysis of home sales and listings in the market. The conditional purchase price is typically 91% - 95% of the home’s market value, minus a 6% real estate sales commission that will be paid when Cash2Key resells the home.</p>

				</ul>
				<strong>What are the steps in the Buy Now, Sell Later Process look like?</strong>
				<p>These are the main steps in a Buy Now, Sell Later transaction</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Pre-approval. To be eligible for Buy Now, Sell Later, the client and their current residence must be pre-approved.  This starts with registering here.  AnnieMac then contacts the client to conduct the pre-approval which takes several days.  If they are pre-approved with Buy Now, Sell Later, a Home Purchase Coordinator is assigned to work with you and your client.</li>
					<li>Buy Now, Sell Later Agreement.  Your Home Purchase Coordinator will discuss the steps and what is required of the client upfront.

					<li>Secure their home. When the seller accepts the offer, you and the buyer can arrange for the home to be inspected and the property appraised.</li> 
					<li>Cash2Key close. AnnieMac Cash2Key will close on the new home.  When they do, your client takes possession and can move in right away.  The rental period begins the day Cash2Key closes.  You will be paid commission when the buyer settles, not at this closing where Cask2Key settles.</li>
					<li>List their old home for sale.  Maybe the home needed some touch up or staging to maximize the sale price.  With two weeks from the Cash2Key close to list their home for sale, there is just enough time to get the property looking right so that buyers bid aggressively.</li>
					<li>Closing sale on the old home and buy back of the new one. When their old home sells, the client is ready to complete the purchase.  In the unlikely event that their old home did not sell in 180 days, Cash2Key will purchase it according to the terms of the conditional purchase price.  In states that charge a real estate transfer tax, the client will be required to pay all of the transfer tax for this final transaction.  You will be paid the real estate commission for this second transaction.</li>
				</ul>
				<strong>When is there two transactions instead of one?</strong>
				<p>Buy Now, Sell Later always involves two transactions. Cash2Key closes on the property followed by your client closing on the property.</p>
				<p>With Cash Offer, when the purchase contract is assigned there is just one transaction. This is helpful in states that charge a transfer tax to avoid unnecessary costs to the client.</p>
				<p>When there is no assignment of contract with Cash Offer, there are two transactions, the Cash2Key closing and your client’s closing.  This can be helpful when the bidding is frenzied on the property because your client can offer a closing in as little as two weeks.</p>
				<strong>Who represents AnnieMac Private Equity Cash2Key in the transaction?</strong>
				<p>You do. The broker buyer agreement will reflect that you represent the buyer and AnnieMac Cash2Key.  In the transactions where there are two closings instead of one, you will be paid for the second transaction and not the first transaction. When there is only one transaction, you will be paid for that transaction.</p>
				<strong>Can I still represent my client on the sale side too?</strong>
				<p>Yes. You will have 180 days to represent them as the listing agent. After the 180th day, they will sell to AnnieMac Cash2Key for the conditional purchase price.  When priced appropriately, the home should sell well within the 180 day window.</p>
				<strong>Who is the Home Purchase Coordinator and what do they do?</strong>
				<p>The Home Purchase Coordinator works for AnnieMac Cash2Key and is a specialist in Cash Offer and Buy Now, Sell Later.  Your transaction is assigned a dedicated Home Purchase Coordinator and your may speak with a different Home Purchase Coordinator if you dedicated HPC is off.  The HPC is there to educate your client and yourself on Cash Offer or Buy Now, Sell Later. They communicate the steps of the transaction to your client, let them know what is required of them, and help you structure the contracts within the bounds of Cash Offer or Buy Now, Sell Later. HPC does not work on your client’s mortgage, their Loan Officer and Processor are the best points of contact for the mortgage.</p>
				<strong>What if my buyer doesn’t fulfill the contract and purchase the home?</strong>
				<p>Cash2Key purchases the property for the sole intent of reserving it for your client. If the buyer defaults on the contract, Cash2Key will retain the buyer agent commission, buyer EMD, and Cash Offer fee to cover the costs of reselling the home. Any rent accrued would be immediately due.</p>
				<strong>How much does it cost?</strong>
				<p>Your client will pay a Cash Offer fee in addition to their earnest money deposit.Typically, the Cash Offer fee and the earnest money together are 3% of the purchase price. If they use AnnieMac Home Mortgage and Community Title, the Cash Offer fee is refunded to them in full. Using a title company familiar with the process for both transactions also makes the process simpler.</p>
				<strong>When does my client pay the fee?</strong>
				<p>Your client pays the earnest money deposit and Cash Offer fee after the seller accepts the offer, typically within 3 days.</p>
				<strong>If my client takes advantage of Buy Now, Sell Later, how is their rent calculated?</strong>
				<p>The rental lease period begins when AnnieMac Cash2Key closes on the purchase of their new home.  Rents are about the same as a mortgage, taxes, and insurance on the property.  Rent is accrued but not paid until the sale of their old home closes, so they never need to make two house payments.</p>
