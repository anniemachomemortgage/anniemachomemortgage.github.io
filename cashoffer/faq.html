						<h3>Cash Offer - Borrower</h3>
						<details>
						<summary>What is an AnnieMac Cash2Key Cash Offer?</summary>
						<p>A Cash2Key offer is a purchase contract backed by a cash offer.  After a short due diligence period where you can have a home inspection and appraisal, the cash offer becomes non-refundable and the seller knows that it will close.  You may choose to have the purchase contract assigned to you so that you close as the buyer, or have Cash2Key close quickly and then sell the property to you for the same price.</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>Why are Cash Offer’s better than an offer with mortgage financing?</summary>

						<h3>Buy Now, Sell Later - Realtor</h3>
					<details>
						<summary>What if I need to sell my home to buy another?</summary>
						<p>Buy Now, Sell Later, as the name states, allows you to turn this traditional requirement on its head and by before you sell.  AnnieMac Cash2Key will make a cash offer on your behalf and allow you to move in and rent immediately upon closing.  The rent is accrued but not immediately paid, so you will never have two housing payments.  After you have sold your old home, you will buy your new home back from Cash2Key.</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>What is the AnnieMac Cash2Key Buy Now, Sell Later program?</summary>

Buy and move first, then prep and stage your home to maximize your sale price.</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>Does AnnieMac Cash2Key purchase your current home?</summary>

					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>How much will the rent be on my home until I complete the purchase?</summary>
						<p>The rent will be approximately what mortgage, tax, and insurance payments will be on the property.  You will accrue rent from the day that AnnieMac Cash2Key purchases your property but will not pay the rent until you sell your home.  The rent will be pro-rated on a daily basis, so you won’t pay a full-months rent if you rent for less than the full month. The Buy Now, Sell Later agreement that you sign after pre-approval specifies your rental payment.</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>How do you determine how much equity I have in my home?</summary>
						<p>Typically, an interior BPO, broker price opinion, must be conducted on your current home.</p>
					</details>
					<details>

						</ul>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>What are the steps in the Buy Now, Sell Later Process look like?</summary>
						<p>These are the main steps in a Buy Now, Sell Later transaction</p>
						<ul>

In the unlikely event that their old home did not sell in 180 days, Cash2Key will purchase it according to the terms of the conditional purchase price.  In states that charge a real estate transfer tax, the client will be required to pay all of the transfer tax for this final transaction.  You will be paid the real estate commission for this second transaction.</li>
						</ul>
					</details>

						<p>With Cash Offer, when the purchase contract is assigned there is just one transaction. This is helpful in states that charge a transfer tax to avoid unnecessary costs to the client.</p>
						<p>When there is no assignment of contract with Cash Offer, there are two transactions, the Cash2Key closing and your client’s closing.  This can be helpful when the bidding is frenzied on the property because your client can offer a closing in as little as two weeks.</p>

					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>How much does it cost?</summary>
