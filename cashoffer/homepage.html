                    <p>Whether you are a first-time home buyer or existing homeowner looking to move or upgrade, shopping for the home of your dreams isn't easy. Competition is fierce in today's market, and chances are that your offer is being pitted against a dozen other buyers bidding way above market value, or something even more enticing to sellers... cold, hard cash. In fact, many older buyers looking to downsize are using their equity and long-term stock market earnings to make significant cash offers, allowing them to snatch the perfect homes right out of your hands.</p>
                    <p>At AnnieMac Home Mortgage, we want you to have a fair shot at owning a home your family will love. That's why we've created two groundbreaking programs that offer both new and existing homeowners a smooth, stress-free path to your ideal homes.</p>

                            <p>Are you a first-time home buyer? That fact alone might get your best offers ignored by homeowners, but just because you’re starting from scratch doesn’t mean you don’t deserve the home of your dreams – and that’s where this program evens the odds. Nothing generates interest or conveys financial confidence to home sellers or their agents like a strong cash offer, and this program will help you make an offer that they simply can’t refuse.</p>
