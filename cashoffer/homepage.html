Header: Make a Cash Offer They Can’t Refuse

Whether you are a first-time home buyer or existing homeowner looking to move or upgrade, shopping for the home of your dreams isn't easy. Competition is fierce in today's market, and chances are that your offer is being pitted against a dozen other buyers bidding way above market value, or something even more enticing to sellers... cold, hard cash. In fact, many older buyers looking to downsize are using their equity and long-term stock market earnings to make significant cash offers, allowing them to snatch the perfect homes right out of your hands. 

At AnnieMac Home Mortgage, we want you to have a fair shot at owning a home your family will love. That's why we've created two groundbreaking programs that offer both new and existing homeowners a smooth, stress-free path to your ideal homes.

(on Left)    Cash Offer
Are you a first-time home buyer? That fact alone might get your best offers ignored by homeowners, but just because you’re starting from scratch doesn’t mean you don’t deserve the home of your dreams – and that’s where this program evens the odds. Nothing generates interest or conveys financial confidence to home sellers or their agents like a strong cash offer, and this program will help you make an offer that they simply can’t refuse.

How It Works  >
1)	Get Preapproved – Much like a standard mortgage loan, AnnieMac will guide you through a simple approval process 
2)	Make an Offer – Find the home of your dreams and we’ll work together to make a cash offer they can’t refuse!
3)	Decide Your Path – You can agree to close on the home directly or, for a quick close, arrange for AnnieMac to buy it and sell to you. It’s your call!
4)	Get Ready to Close– Once the seller accepts your offer, you simply pay the earnest money deposit, schedule the home inspection, and start the processing of your mortgage.
5)	Seal the Deal – Either close on the home directly or buy it from AnnieMac as agreed upon. Either way, the home of your dreams is finally yours!

Buy Now, Sell Later
Perfect for current homeowners, this convenient program eliminates the need to sell your home before buying a new one. Instead of sweating out the entire process, we make it simple, stress-free and fun!  How? We simply provide the funds that will allow you to offer the seller the perfect cash offer. We buy the home so you can move right in while taking the time to comfortably sell your old one, enabling you to patiently maximize your profit by accepting the highest offer possible. Then, we sell that new dream home directly to you as soon as you are free and clear to sign on the dotted line – easy!
