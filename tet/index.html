<h3>What to Look for When Going to Open Houses</h3>
<p>Attending open houses is one of the most important parts of shopping for a home. When attending an open house, remember to be a smart buyer and look at more than just the aesthetics of the house. Here are some tips for how to navigate an open house and red flags to look for while touring the home.</p>
<h4>Open House Tips</h4>
<p>When you visit open houses, you should always have several questions prepared for the seller’s agent as well as conduct research before you view the home. You will want to leave the open house feeling as though you have enough information to make a well-informed decision about the home.</p>
<h5>Make a Good First Impression</h5>
<p>When attending an open house, put your best face forward and make sure you dress appropriately. Dressing business-casual can help you look like a serious buyer and impress the seller’s agent. Also, always be courteous to the agent and do not be afraid to ask questions.</p>

<h5>Know What You Need to Look For</h5>
<p>When looking at the home's interior, keep an eye out for various issues like uneven floors, water stains, cracks in the ceilings or walls, and mold. For the exterior, you will want to check for any damage to the outer walls or if the roof has any issues. If you can easily spot damage to the home, it may not be worth your time due to the cost of repairs which could affect your budget. Make sure to take pictures of the inside and outside of the house.</p>
<h5>Be A Memorable Visitor</h5>
<p>It is important to ensure that the seller’s agent remembers you. How do you do that? Build a good relationship with the agent by sharing stories, ask the agent about their family, and ask them how they got started in the real estate business. Be sure to make a genuine effort to get to know them in the small amount of time you spend at the home. Agents will remember buyers who make an effort.</p>
<h4>Ask the Right Questions</h4>
<p>Open houses are the perfect time to ask every question you have about the home and get any information you may need that is not listed in the home brochure. Here are a few important questions to ask during an open house:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many offers has the seller received?</li>
<li>Why are the sellers moving?</li>
<li>How long has the property been on the market?</li>
<li>When was the house built?</li>
<li>Has there been any updates on the home since it was built?</li>
<li>How much are monthly utility bills?</li>
<li>How motivated is the seller to sell the home?</li>
<li>How are the local schools?</li>
<li>What is the noise level in the neighborhood?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions can give you more insight into the home and the surrounding area and can improve your decision-making process.</p>

<h4>Open House Red Flags – Be Cautious</h4>
<p>When touring an open house, it is easy to get distracted by things that do not matter that much. There are important things to look for when touring a home, some being obvious and others that are not. Here are some red flags to check for when going to an open house.</p>
<h5>Signs of Water Damage</h5>
<p>Signs of water damage are not always obvious. Be sure to look for brown water lines across ceilings and on walls. If the home has a basement, be sure to look at the carpet, walls and flooring. Touch the carpet and feel for any wetness, especially if there has been a big rainstorm recently. Musty smells can also indicate that water is inside the home where it does not belong</p>
<h5>Cracks in the Foundation</h5>
<p>Foundation cracks may not be very obvious, but you can check for misaligned doors and windows, sticking doors, and sloping stairs which are all signs that the home is not solidly anchored.</p>
<h5>Window Issues</h5>
<p>Make sure to test out the windows in the homes as older windows may not close tightly, making for a higher utility bill. Test the windows to ensure that they open easily and close the same way.</p>
<h5>Storage Space</h5>
<p>Is there space in the home to store holiday decorations, out-of-season clothing, seasonal equipment? Make sure there are normal closet spaces as well as storage space to store all your extra items.</p>
<p>Attending an open house can feel intimidating but if you know what to look for and what questions to ask, you will do great! Going to an open house is an exciting experience and is a great step toward owning your dream home.</p>
